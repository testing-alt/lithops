# Lithops and IBM Virtual Private Cloud

The IBM VPC client of Lithops can provide a truely serverless user experience on top of IBM VPC where Lithops creates new VSIs (Virtual Server Instance)  dynamically in runtime and scale Lithops jobs against generated VSIs. Alternatively Lithops can start and stop existing VSI instances.

## IBM VPC
The assumption that you already familiar with IBM Cloud, have your IBM IAM API key created (you can create new keys [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys)), have valid IBM COS account, region and resource group.

Follow [IBM VPC setup](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/overview) if you need to create IBM Virtual Private Cloud. Decide the region for your VPC. The best practice is to use the same region both for VPC and IBM COS, hoewever there is no requirement to keep them in the same region.

### The following is the minimum setup requirements

1. Create new VPC if you don't have one already. More details [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/vpcs)
2. Create new subnet with public gateway and IP range and total count. More details [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/subnets)
3. Create new access contol list. More details [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/acl)
4. Create security group for your resource group. More details [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/securityGroups)
5. Create a SSH key in [IBM VPC SSH keys UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/compute/sshKeys)

## Choose an operating system image for VSI
Any Virtual Service Instance (VSI) need to define the instanceâ€™s operating system and version. Lithops support both standard operting system choices provided by the VPC or using pre-defined custom images that already contains all dependencies required by Lithops.

### Using the standard operating system image
Lithops uses by default the Ubuntu 20.04 image. In this case, no further action are required and you can continue to the next step. Lithops will install all required dependencies in the VSI by itself. Notice this can consume about 3 min to complete all installations.

### Using a custom operating system image
This is preferable approach, as using pre-built custom image will greatly improve time that of VSI creation for Lithops jobs. To benefit from this approach, navigate to [runtime/ibm_vpc](../../runtime/ibm_vpc), and follow the instructions.

## Lithops and the VSI auto create mode
In this mode, Lithops will automatically create new worker VM instances in runtime, scale Lithops job against generated VMs, and automatically delete VMs when the job is completed.

### Lithops configuration for the auto create mode

Edit your lithops config and add the relevant keys:

```yaml
lithops:
  mode: standalone

ibm:
  iam_api_key: <iam-api-key>

standalone:
  backend: ibm_vpc
  exec_mode: create

  #optional
  # Use False for custom image that contains Lithops runtime
  pull_runtime: <True/False>

ibm_vpc:
  endpoint: <REGION_ENDPOINT>
  vpc_id: <VPC_ID>
  resource_group_id: <RESOURCE_GROUP_ID>
  security_group_id: <SECURITY_GROUP_ID>
  subnet_id: <SUBNET_ID>
  key_id: <PUBLIC_KEY_ID>

  #optional
  # Either VPC defaults or custom image
  image_id: <IMAGE_ID_FOR_VMs>
  # SSH user to access VPC.
  ssh_user : <SSH_USER_FOR_VPC> # Default is 'root'
  #Path to the ssh key file provided to create the VM.
  ssh_key_filename : <PATH_TO_SSH_KEYFILE> # Default path in OS
  #Profile name for the worker VMs
  profile_name: <PROFILE_NAME> # Default is 'cx2-2x4'
  #Profile name for the master VM
  master_profile_name:  <PROFILE_NAME> # Default is 'cx2-2x4'

```

The fastest way to find all the required keys for `ibm_vpc` section as follows:

1. Login to IBM Cloud and open up your [dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/).
2. Navigate to your [IBM VPC create instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/provision/vs).
3. On the left, fill all the parameters required for your new VM instance creation: name, resource group, location, ssh key, vpc. Choose either Ubuntu 20.04 VSI standard image or choose your **custom image** from the previous step
4. On the right, click `Get sample API call`.
5. Copy to clipboard the code from the `REST request: Creating a virtual server instance` dialog and paste to your favorite editor.
6. Close the `Create instance` window without creating it.
7. In the code, find `security_groups` section and paste its `id` value to the .lithops_config ibm_vpc section security_group_id key.
8. Find `subnet` section and paste its `id` value to the .lithops_config ibm_vpc section subnet_id key.
9. Find `keys` section and paste its `id` value to the .lithops_config ibm_vpc section key_id key.
10. Find `resource_group` section and paste its `id` value to the .lithops_config ibm_vpc section resource_group_id key.
11. Find `vpc` section and paste its `id` value to the .lithops_config ibm_vpc section vpc_id key.


### Verify auto create mode with Lithops

To verify auto create mode is working, use the following example

```python
iterdata = [1,2,3,4]

def my_map_function(x):
    return x + 7

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fexec = lithops.FunctionExecutor()
    fexec.map(my_map_function, iterdata)
    print (fexec.get_result())
```

This will create 4 different VM instance and execute `my_map_function` in the each of created VM. Upon completion, Lithops will delete the VMs.

###  Important information
1. The first time you use Lithops with specific runtime, Lithops will try generate and obtain runtime metadata. For this purpose Lithops will create a VM, extract specific metadata and delete VM. All further executions against same runtime will skip this step as runtime metadata will be cached both locally and in IBM COS.
2. In certain cases where ssh access details are wrong, Lithops might fail to ssh into created VM from the previous step. In this case, fix the ssh access credentials, navigate into dashboard of IBM VPC and manually delete the VM and floating IP associated with it.
3.	The first time you deplopy Lithops job in the auto create mode it is advised to navigate to dashboard of IBM VPC and verify that VM is being created and deleted.
4. If running Lithops over Gen2 fails with error message that decode() in pyJWT need `algorithms` then please make sure pyJWT is version `1.7.1` installed. If needed execute `pip install -U PyJWT==1.7.1`

## Lithops and the VSI consume mode

In this mode, Lithops can start and stop existing VM and deploy an entire job to that VM. The partition logic in this scenario is different from the auto create mode, since entire job executed in the same VM. As example
    
```python
iterdata = [1, 2, 3, 4]

def my_map_function(x):
    return x + 7

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fexec = lithops.FunctionExecutor()
    fexec.map(my_map_function, iterdata)
    print (fexec.get_result())
```

### Lithops configuration for the consume mode

Edit your lithops config and add the relevant keys:

   ```yaml
   lithops:
	  mode: standalone

   ibm:
	  iam_api_key: <iam-api-key>

	standalone:
	  backend: ibm_vpc

   ibm_vpc:
      endpoint   : <REGION_ENDPOINT>
      instance_id : <INSTANCE ID OF THE VM>
      ip_address  : <FLOATING IP ADDRESS OF THE VM>

      #optional

      # SSH user to access VPC.
      ssh_user : <SSH_USER_FOR_VPC> # Default is 'root'
      #Path to the ssh key file provided to create the VM.
      ssh_key_filename : <PATH_TO_SSH_KEYFILE> # Default path in OS

   ```

If you need to create new VM, then follow the steps to create and update Lithops configuration:

1. Create an Ubuntu 20.04 virtual server instance (VSI) in [IBM VPC virtual server instances UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/compute/vs) with CPUs and RAM needed for your application.
2. Reserve and associate a floating IP address in [IBM VPC floating IPs UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/floatingIPs) to be used for the virtual server instance.
3. Get the floating IP address of your virtual server instance which can be found [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/floatingIPs).
4. Get the endpoint of your subnet region, endpoint URLs list can be found [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/vpc#endpoint-url).
5. Get the virtual server instance ID by selecting on your instance in [IBM VPC virtual server instances UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/compute/vs) and then extracting from the instance's details.

### Summary of the configuration keys for the consume mode

|Group|Key|Default|Mandatory|Additional info|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ibm_vpc | endpoint | |yes | Endpoint of your subnet region |
|ibm_vpc | instance_id | | yes | virtual server instance ID |
|ibm_vpc | ip_address | | yes | Floatting IP address atached to your Vm instance|
|ibm_vpc | ssh_key_filename | | no | Path to the ssh key file provided to create the VM. It will use the default path if not provided |
|ibm_vpc | delete_on_dismantle | False| no | Delete the VM when it is stopped |
